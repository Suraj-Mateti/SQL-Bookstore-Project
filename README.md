## üìä Example Queries
- **Retrieve all books in Fiction genre**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Genre = 'Fiction';
Find the most expensive book

SELECT * FROM Books ORDER BY Price DESC LIMIT 1;


Total revenue generated

SELECT SUM(Total_Amount) AS Revenue FROM Orders;


Most frequently ordered book

SELECT o.Book_ID, b.Title, COUNT(o.Order_ID) AS Order_Count
FROM Orders o
JOIN Books b ON o.Book_ID = b.Book_ID
GROUP BY o.Book_ID, b.Title
ORDER BY Order_Count DESC
LIMIT 1;
